# --------------draw conditions-------------------
# Stalemate: This occurs when a player is not in check but has no legal moves. In other words, it’s their turn, but they can’t move without putting their king in check.

# Threefold Repetition: A game can be drawn if the same board position occurs three times during a game with the same player to move each time. The repeated positions do not need to occur in succession.

# Fifty-Move Rule: If fifty moves have been made by each player without any pawn movement or any capture, a player can claim a draw.

# Insufficient Material: The game is drawn when neither player has enough pieces to deliver a checkmate. This typically happens when there is only one king left on each side, or a king and a minor piece (bishop or knight) against a lone king.

# Mutual Agreement: The players can simply agree to a draw at any point during the game.
